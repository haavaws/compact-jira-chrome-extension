# Compact JIRA
This chrome extension allows you to customize your JIRA Kanban board by hiding certain elements on the issue cards, making the overview more compact. Also includes party feature!

## How to install
The extension is currently not on the Chrome store, however it can still be installed manually:

1. Download the `build/distributions` folder in this repository
2. Load the unpacked extension ([Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked))
3. Select the `build/distrubutions` folder

## Usage
By default, most elements in the Kanban board issue cards are hidden. They can be toggled in the extension popup.
